You need to back up computer data for offices situated along single street.
You decide to pair off the offices. For each pair of offices you run a network
cable between the two buildings so that they can back up each others’ data.
However, your local telecommunications company will only give you K
network cables, which means you can only arrange backups for K pairs
of offices (2K offices in total). No office may belong to more than one
pair (that is, these 2K offices must all be different). Furthermore, the
telecommunications company charges by the kilometre. This means that
you need to choose these K pairs of offices so that you use as little cable
as possible.
As an example, suppose you had five offices on a street, situated at distance
1, 3, 4, 6 and 12 from the beginning of the street, and the telecommuni-
cations company will provides you with K = 2 cables. The best pairing
in this example is created by linking the first and second offices together,
and linking the third and fourth offices together. This uses K = 2 cables
as required, where the first cable has length 3 1 = 2, and the second cable
has length 6 4 = 2. This pairing requires a total of 4 of network cables,
which is the smallest total possible.
Given the locations of N offices and the number of cables K that are made
available, compute the cost in cable length of the best K way pairing. Here
N ≤ 100, 000.
